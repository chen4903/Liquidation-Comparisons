# Liquidation-Comparisons 

We have [Chinese Version](https://github.com/chen4903/Liquidation-Comparisons/blob/master/README_CN.md).

## Brief

We use Foundry to conduct practical demonstrations of liquidate various lending protocols, with the goal of achieving higher profits and explaining the liquidation strategies as clearly as possible.

## Protocols

| Protocols   | Liquidation functions |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| AAVE_V2     | liquidationCall()     |
| Compound_V2 | ...                   |
| ...         | ...                   |

## Effect factors

How to maximize profits? The influencing factors generally include the following:

- healthFactor: It's not true that the closer it gets to 1, the greater the profit is.
- gas: If the profit you earn after liquidation can not cover gas, you would lose money.
- The amount of Liquidation: The max ratio of liquidation that can be made for each protocol varies. E.g. AAVEV2 is 50%. How much should we liquidation is an issue?
- Liquidation reward: Do you want underlying token or aToken?
- Slippage:
  - To swap the token that we get after liquidation to the token we want.
  - The best path to swap, making the slippage the lowest.
- User's debt specifications
  - Price: The price of the token that user borrows and collaterals.
  - Amount: The amount you can get after liquidation and the depth of the pool will influence the output of swap directly.
- Flashloan(If you liquidate by flashloan):
  - Flashloan fee.
  - The pool's depth limits the number you can flashloan.

## Math

> Assuming that all swaps are priced in WETH, all swaps will ultimately be converted to WETH

We define:

- a: The amount of flashloan.
- b: The fee of flashloan.
- c: gas.
- d: The amount of WETH after liquidation and swap we can get.
- P: The profit we earn ultimately.

We can infer:
$$
P = d - b -c \qquad [f(a) = d]
$$
`a` will indirectly affect `d`, and `a` represents your liquidation ability under the flashloan. Your liquidation strategy directly affect profits, and are influenced by a mixture of the seven effect factors mentioned above, so the logic behind this will not be simple and clear. Let's further calculate the `d`:

### eth

#### AAVE_V2

We demonstrated this [Liquidation](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xac7df37a43fab1b130318bbb761861b8357650db2e2c6493b73d6da3d9581077),searching for the maximum liquidation profit situation, we get 43.830663994245593622 ETH. The details can be seen in `test/eth/AAVE_V2_tx1.sol`.

As the following pictures, we use excel to induce the debt and asset flow before and after liquidation. The source file is in `SourceMaterials/AAVE_V2_tx1.xlsx`(Windows 11 file).

I don't have a good liquidation strategy and technique. I just try different number to liquidate and test it again and again until finding a profit I can bear. What I am interested are 2 stuff: 

- How much USDT should I flashloan to liquidate? The more I flashloan, the higher reward we can get after liquidation while the flashloan fee is higher.
- How to choose a nice path to swap? We should considerate the slippage.

I show my logic in the following picture:

![image-20240402171609984](README/image-20240402171609984.png)

I choose: 

- Flashloan for 1_744_500.000_000 USDT to liquidate. (Do not ask me how to get this number, I just keep the path unchanged and change the USDT amount again and again. I am a noob of liquidation, I think there must be a better strategy to liquidate.)
- Use`path=[WBTC=>WETH]` to pay back flashloan.
- Use `path=[WBTC=>WETH]` to swap and get WETH.

I discover 3 things finally:

- Not true that the healthFactor is close to 1, the profit is higher.
- No one can find the best strategy but only search for a better strategy.
- We don't considerate the gas in our test. If we add many logic and OPCODE in the strategy, the gas will cost more. So in the actual production environment, especially when the network is in jam, gas should be a critical effect factor.
